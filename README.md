This project presents a Transformer-based Actor–Critic Reinforcement Learning model for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) without relying on traditional handcrafted heuristics. The approach combines a Transformer encoder for capturing global relationships between cities with a Pointer Network decoder that constructs valid tours step-by-step. Using policy-gradient optimization with a critic value function, the model learns to generate near-optimal routes through experience, improving its decisions over time. The system includes performance evaluation, learning curve visualization, and route plotting, demonstrating steady convergence and consistent improvements over baseline heuristics. This implementation shows how modern deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques can be applied effectively to complex combinatorial optimization problems.
